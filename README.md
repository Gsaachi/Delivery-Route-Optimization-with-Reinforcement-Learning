# Delivery-Route-Optimization-with-Reinforcement-Learning
This project implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL) environment for optimizing delivery routes between cities. The system models multiple transport modes (flight, train, truck, ship) with varying costs and speeds. The agent learns to choose the most efficient and cost-effective delivery strategy.
